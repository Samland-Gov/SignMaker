# Sign Maker

![SignMaker Preview Thumbnail](img/example/tempache1.png)

A JavaScript-based app for creating highway guide signs. Based off of [Kurumi's Sign Maker](http://www.kurumi.com/roads/signmaker), and forked from [dki-os](https://github.com/dki-os/SignMaker). Allows for the creation of highway guide signs in the style defined by the United States FHWA in their [MUTCD](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm). Modifications have been made for [OpenGeoFiction](https://opengeofiction.net/#map=6/-36.198/149.063&layers=B), specifically the [FSA Project](https://wiki.opengeofiction.net/index.php/Collab:Federal_States/Transportation).
